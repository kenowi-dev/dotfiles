# dotfiles

This is a repo with my dotfiles.
Currently there are only zsh dotfiles. This will most likely change in the future.

## Installation

Currently there is no installation script. 
All dotfiles have to be moved manually. It is recommended to place them all in your home directory.

## Powerlevel Theme
 
The powerlevel theme that is used, is created will using the [Nord Theme for Konsole](https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord-konsole). This means, that the colors may vary depending on the terminal theme used. This will hopefully change in the future, so that the theme is independent from the terminal.
